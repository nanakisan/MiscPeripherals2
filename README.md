MiscPeripherals2
================
My attempt at porting MiscPeripherals by RichardG to Minecraft 1.7.10. It's my first attempt at modding, so no promises!

Ported to Forge 1226 for MC 1.7.10 and CC 1.65.

Notes:
- RichardG released MiscPeripherals' source into the public domain. You can find a link to his statement on the MiscPeripherals2 wiki.
- JACOB (the library that provides the text-to-speech service on Windows) is licensed under LGPL; this means that developers using the library are required to publish the source code for it.
- JACOB's source code, as well as that of MiscPeripherals2, is available at https://github.com/J15t98J/MiscPeripherals2
